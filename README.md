This storage bin mainly records the open-circuit fault diagnosis data set of multi-phase converter used in the paper "Fully Simulated Data-Driven Domain Generalized Method for Multiphase Converters Fault Diagnosis," in IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, vol. 40, no. 1, pp. 2099-2113, Jan. 2025, doi: 10.1109/TPEL.2024.3461159. It mainly includes : 
1 The simulation domain data set of five-phase induction motor AA ; 
2 experimental domain data set of five-phase induction motor AA ;
3 The simulation domain data set of five-phase induction motor BB ; 
4 The experimental domain data set of five-phase induction motor AA under different signal-to-noise ratio interference ; 
5 The simulation domain data set of dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor AA ; 
6 Experimental domain data set of dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor AA. 
Each '.mat ' file in the above data set records data with a time scale of about 1s, where 0-0.5s is the health state and 0.5s-1.0s is the fault state.
All the experimental domain data sets have a dynamic transition period ( fault transient ). The simulation domain data set abandons the dynamic transition period when it is constructed, which can be regarded as the ' splicing ' of the health state and the fault state. 
In addition, the rotor speed, load torque and category labels corresponding to each '.mat ' file in the five-phase induction motor simulation domain and experimental domain data set are stored in the corresponding Excel files.
